# Blockchain Voting System

Welcome to the Blockchain Voting System! This project provides a secure and transparent way to conduct elections using blockchain technology.

## Introduction

Our Blockchain Voting System ensures the integrity of the voting process and allows developers to integrate it into their projects easily.

## Features

- Secure and tamper-proof voting system
- Transparent and auditable election process
- Integration-friendly for developers
- Supports registration of voters and candidates
- Scalable and efficient blockchain technology
